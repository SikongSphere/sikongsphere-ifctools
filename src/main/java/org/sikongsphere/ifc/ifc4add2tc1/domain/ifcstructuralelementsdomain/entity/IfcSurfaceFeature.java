/**
 * A surface feature is a modification at (onto, or into) of the surface of an element. Parts of the surface of the entire surface may be affected. The volume and mass of the element may be increased, remain unchanged, or be decreased by the surface feature, depending on manufacturing technology. However, any increase or decrease of volume is small compared to the total volume of the element.
