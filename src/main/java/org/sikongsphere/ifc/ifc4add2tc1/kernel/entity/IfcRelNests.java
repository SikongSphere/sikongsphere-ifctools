/**
 * The nesting relationship IfcRelNests is a special type of the general composition/decomposition (or whole/part) relationship IfcRelDecomposes. The nesting relationship can be applied to all non physical subtypes of object and object types, namely processes, controls (like cost items), and resources. It can also be applied to physical subtypes of object and object types, namely elements having ports. The nesting implies an order among the nested parts.
