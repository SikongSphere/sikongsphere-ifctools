 * An IfcPlate is a planar and often flat part with constant thickness. A plate may carry loads between or beyond points of support, or provide stiffening. The location of the plate (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is not relevant to its definition (in contrary to IfcWall and IfcSlab (as floor slab)).
