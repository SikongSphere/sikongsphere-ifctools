/**
 * IfcGrid ia a planar design grid defined in 3D space used as an aid in locating structural and design elements. The position of the grid (ObjectPlacement) is defined by a 3D coordinate system (and thereby the design grid can be used in plan, section or in any position relative to the world coordinate system). The position can be relative to the object placement of other products or grids. The XY plane of the 3D coordinate system is used to place the grid axes, which are 2D curves (for example, line, circle, arc, polyline).
