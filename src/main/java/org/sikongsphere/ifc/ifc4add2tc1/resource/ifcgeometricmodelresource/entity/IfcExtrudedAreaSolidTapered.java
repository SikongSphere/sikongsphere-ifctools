/**
 * IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered is defined by sweeping a crosssection along a linear spine. The cross section may change alongthe sweep from the shape of the start cross section into theshape of the end cross section. The resulting solid is bounded bythree or more faces: A start face, an end face (each defined bystart and end planes and sections), and one or more lateralfaces. Each lateral face is a ruled surface defined by a pair ofcorresponding edges of the start and end section.
