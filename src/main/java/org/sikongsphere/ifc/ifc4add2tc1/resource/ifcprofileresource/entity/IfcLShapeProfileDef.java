 * IfcLShapeProfileDefdefines a section profile that provides the defining parameters of anL-shaped section (equilateral L profiles are also covered by thisentity) to be used by the swept areasolid. Its parameters and orientation relative to the positioncoordinate system are according to the following illustration. Theshorter leg has the same direction as the positive Position.P[1]-axis, the longeror equal leg the same as the positive Position.P[2]-axis. The centre of theposition coordinate system is in the profiles centreof the bounding box.
