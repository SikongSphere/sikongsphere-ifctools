 * IfcDerivedProfileDef defines the profile by transformation from the parent profile. The transformation is given by a two dimensional transformation operator. Transformation includes translation, rotation, mirror and scaling. The latter can be uniform or non uniform. The derived profiles may be used to define swept surfaces, swept area solids or sectioned spines.
