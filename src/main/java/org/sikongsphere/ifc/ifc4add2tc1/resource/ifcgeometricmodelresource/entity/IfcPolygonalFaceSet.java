 * The IfcPolygonalFaceSet is a tessellated face set with all faces being bound by polygons. The planar faces are constructed by implicit polylines defined by three or more Cartesian points. Each planar face is defined by an instance of IfcIndexedPolygonalFace, or in case of faces with inner loops by IfcIndexedPolygonalFaceWithVoids.
