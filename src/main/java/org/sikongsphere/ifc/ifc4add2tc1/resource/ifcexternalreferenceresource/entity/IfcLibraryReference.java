/**
 * An IfcLibraryReference is a reference into a library of information by Location (provided as a URI). It also provides an optional inherited Identification key to allow more specific references to library sections or tables. The inherited Name attribute allows for a human interpretable identification of the library item. Also, general information on the library from which the reference is taken, is given by the ReferencedLibrary relation which identifies the relevant occurrence of IfcLibraryInformation.
