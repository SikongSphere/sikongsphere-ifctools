 * An advanced B-rep is a boundary representation model in which all faces, edges and vertices are explicitly represented. It is a solid with explicit topology and elementary or free-form geometry. The faces of the B-rep are of type IfcAdvancedFace. An advanced B-rep has to meet the same topological constraints as the manifold solid B-rep.
