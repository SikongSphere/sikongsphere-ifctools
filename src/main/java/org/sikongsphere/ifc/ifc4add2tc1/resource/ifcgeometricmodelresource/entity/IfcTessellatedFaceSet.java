/**
 * The IfcTessellatedFaceSet is a boundary representation topological model limited to planar faces and straight edges. It may represent an approximation of an analytical surface or solid that may be provided in addition to its tessellation as a separate shape representation. The IfcTessellatedFaceSet provides a compact data representation of an connected face set using indices into ordered lists of vertices, normals, colours, and texture maps.
