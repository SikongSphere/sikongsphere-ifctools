 * The coordinate operation is an abstract supertype to handle any operation (transformation or conversion) between two coordinate reference systems. It is meant to provide expandability for future versions, since currently only the conversion of a local engineering coordinate system into a map coordinate reference system is dealt with by the subtype IfcMapConversion.
