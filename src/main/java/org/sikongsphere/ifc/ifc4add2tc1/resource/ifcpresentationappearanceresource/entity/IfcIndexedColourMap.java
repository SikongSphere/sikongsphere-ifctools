/**
 * The IfcIndexedColourMap provides the assignment of colour information to individual faces. It is used for colouring faces of tessellated face sets. The IfcIndexedColourMap defines an index into an indexed list of colour information. The Colours are a two-dimensional list of colours provided by three RGB values. The ColourIndex attribute corresponds to the CoordIndex of the IfcTessellatedFaceSet defining the corresponding index list of faces. The Opacity attribute provides the alpha channel for all faces of the tessellated face set.
