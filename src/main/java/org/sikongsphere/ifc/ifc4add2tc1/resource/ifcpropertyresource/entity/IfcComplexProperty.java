 * IfcComplexProperty is used to define complex properties to be handled completely within a property set.

This enables the definition of a set of properties to be included as a single 'property' entry in an IfcPropertySet. The definition of such an IfcComplexProperty can be reused in many different IfcPropertySet's.
