 * An IfcCurveStyle provides the style table for presentation information assigned to geometric curves. The style is defined by a color, a font and a width. The IfcCurveStyle defines curve patterns as model patterns, that is, the distance between visible and invisible segments of curve patterns are given in model space dimensions (that have to be scaled using the target plot scale).
