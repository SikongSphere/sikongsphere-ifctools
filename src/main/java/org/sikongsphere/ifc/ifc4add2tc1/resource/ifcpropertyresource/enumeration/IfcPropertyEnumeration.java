/**
 * IfcPropertyEnumeration is a collection of simple or measure values that define a prescribed set of alternatives fromwhich 'enumeration values' are selected. This enables inclusion of enumeration values in property sets. IfcPropertyEnumerationprovides a name for the enumeration as well as a list of unique (numeric or descriptive) values (that may have a measure typeassigned). The entity defines the list of potential enumerators to be exchanged together (or separately) with properties of type IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue that selects their actual property values from this enumeration.
