/**
 * The polygonal bounded half space is a special subtype of a half space solid, where the material of the half spaceused in Boolean expressions is bounded by a polygonal boundary. The base surface of the half space is positioned by itsnormal relative to the object coordinate system (as defined at the supertype IfcHalfSpaceSolid),Â and itspolygonal (with or without arc segments) boundary is defined in the XY plane of the position coordinate systemestablished by the Position attribute, the subtraction body is extruded perpendicular to the XY plane of theposition coordinate system, that is, into the direction of the positive Z axis defined by the Positionattribute.
