/**
 * The IfcSpecularRoughness defines the datatype for the reflection resulting from the roughness of a surface through the height of surface impurities where the specular highlight is made sharper with small values for the roughness, such as 0.1. Applies to "glass", "metal", "mirror" and "plastic" reflection models. Larger values, close to 1.0 decrease the specular fall-off.
