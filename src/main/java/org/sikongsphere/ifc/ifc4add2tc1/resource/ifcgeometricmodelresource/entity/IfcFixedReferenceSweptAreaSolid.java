/**
 * An IfcFixedReferenceSweptAreaSolid is a type of swept area solid which is the result of sweeping an area along aDirectrix. The swept area is provided by a subtype of IfcProfileDef. The profile is placedby an implicit cartesian transformation operator at the start point of the sweep, where the profile normal agreesto the tangent of the directrix at this point, and the profile's x-axis agrees to the FixedReference direction. The orientation of the curve during the sweeping operation is controlled by the FixedReference direction.
