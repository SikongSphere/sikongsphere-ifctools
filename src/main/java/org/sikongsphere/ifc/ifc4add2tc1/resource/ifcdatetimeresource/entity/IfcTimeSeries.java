/**
 * A time series is a set of a time-stamped data entries. It allows a natural association of data collected over intervals of time. Time series can be regular or irregular. In regular time series data arrive predictably at predefined intervals. In irregular time series some or all time stamps do not follow a repetitive pattern and unpredictable bursts of data may arrive at unspecified points in time.
