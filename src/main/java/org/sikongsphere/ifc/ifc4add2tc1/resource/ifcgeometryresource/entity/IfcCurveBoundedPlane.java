 * The IfcCurveBoundedPlane is a parametric planar surface with curved boundaries defined by one or moreboundary curves. The bounded plane is defined to be the portion of the basis surface in the direction of N x T from anypoint on the boundary, where N is the surface normal and T the boundary curve tangent vector at this point. The regionso defined shall be arcwise connected.
