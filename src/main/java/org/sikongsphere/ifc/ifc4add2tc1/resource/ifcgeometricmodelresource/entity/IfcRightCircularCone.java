 * The IfcRightCircularCone is a Construction SolidGeometry (CSG) 3D primitive. It is a solid with a circular base anda point called apex as the top. The tapers from the base to thetop. The axis from the center of the circular base to the apex isperpendicular to the base. The inherited Positionattribute defines the IfcAxisPlacement3D and provides thelocation and orientation of the cone:
