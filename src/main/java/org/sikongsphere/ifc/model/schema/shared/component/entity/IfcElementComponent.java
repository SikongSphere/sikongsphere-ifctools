/**
 * An element component is a representation for minor items included in, added to or connecting to or between elements,
 * which usually are not of interest from the overall building structure viewpoint. However, these small parts may have
 * vital and load carrying functions within the construction. These items do not provide any actual space boundaries.
 * Typical examples of IfcElementComponents include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories.
